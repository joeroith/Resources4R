## Additional R learning resources
There are tons of resources out there to learn R on your own and it can be a little overwhelming. If you would like to dive deeper into R, or find help with more specific types of data analysis, these resources may help.

- **Online**
    - [A Gentle Introduction to Tidy Statistics in R](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/a-gentle-introduction-to-tidy-statistics-in-r/) (*webinar - 54 min*)
    - [learnR4free](https://www.learnr4free.com/index.html)
    - [RStudio primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers)
    - [R Bootcamp](https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app/)
    - [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) (more traditional R in the RStudio environment)
    - [More resources for intermediate R users](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/intermediate/)

- **Free (or cheap) textbooks**
    - [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund
    - [*A Modern Dive into R and the Tidyverse*](https://moderndive.com/) by Chester Ismay and Albert Y. Kim

- **Stuck in R?** Someone out there probably has a solution, try finding it![^1]
    - Search the help documentation for a particular function directly in RStudio
    - [Google it](https://www.google.com/) (*Pro tip:* we do it every time we code!)
    - [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

[^1]: Understanding documentation and code written by others is an acquired skill that takes practice. Just try it out and remember, you can't break R!
    

## Different ways to use R
Want to continue using R offline? Have an awesome IT department that will build and maintain a free server? Just want to use the Cloud? You can download and run R locally for all of your projects. Just remember, you need both R (the engine) and RStudio (the steering wheel, dashboard, and pedals). While you may never actually open R, it's important to keep it installed and up to date. You will also need to set up your library, so don't forget to install and load those packages.
